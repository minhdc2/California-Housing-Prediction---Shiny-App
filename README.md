# California-Housing-Prediction---Shiny-App

Housing is considered one of the most fundamental human needs. However, buying a house is not an easy goal for everyone, many people have to work 10-15 years or even more to save enough money to buy one. Normally, a transaction is made based on the direct negotiation between the buyer and seller. And a seller is always seeking to sell at a high value to gain a huge profit, therefore, if a buyer does not analyze the house thoroughly, the buyer can easily be scammed.

To determine the accurate value of a house, various factors should be considered, including the prices of similar properties, the condition and age of the house, its size, the state of the market, and the local area. Considering all of this information requires significant time and effort, hence, I would like to make an application to assist buyers on estimating house value more quickly and reliably by using a mixture of statistical methods, which combines linear regression and clustering technique.

In this prototype, I used the California Housing dataset sourced from: https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2/tree/master/datasets/housing
The purpose is to predict median house value by using the following variables:

* Longitude
* Latitude
* Housing Median Age
* Total Rooms
* Total Bedrooms
* Population
* Households
* Median Income
* Ocean Proximity

The application can be accessed via: https://minhdc2.shinyapps.io/TrentU_TermProject/
